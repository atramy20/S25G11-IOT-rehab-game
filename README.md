## Rehab Game Project by :  Ramy Abu Tareef, Razi Hussein, Jamelih Khirbawe
  
## Details about the project:
This project is an interactive rehabilitation system based on an ESP32 microcontroller. It features multiple game modes—Memory, Focus, and Reaction—designed to train cognitive and motor skills through LED-button interactions. Players are identified using RFID tags, allowing for personalized tracking of high scores. The system includes visual (LED) and auditory (sound) feedback for each interaction, and difficulty levels can be adjusted (e.g., in Reaction mode). A built-in display provides real-time instructions, scores, and player feedback, making the game engaging and suitable for both therapeutic and recreational use.
